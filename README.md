Doukan is the admin console that manages the plumbing behind Palala, which is my view of the information stream that makes up my connected, online life.

It allows the different parts of Palala to be managed, installed or removed by the command line or, if already connected to Palala, a special command-and-control channel.

Doukan requires at a minimum the configuration information to connect to Redis. All other items will be discovered once Doukan connects to Redis and establishes the command-and-control channel.
